# Password Strength Checker

A Python program that evaluates the strength of a password using multiple criteria, calculates its entropy, and provides suggestions for improvement. The program also checks whether the password is commonly used to alert the user if it is potentially unsafe.

## Features
- Checks password for:
  - Minimum length
  - Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Special characters
- Calculates entropy to measure password randomness
- Warns if the password is in a common password list
- Provides actionable suggestions to improve password strength

## How to Use
1. Download the repository.
2. Ensure `common_passwords.txt` is in the same folder as the Python script.
3. Run "Password Strength Checker.py"
4. Enter a password when prompted.

## Skills Learned
- Python programming
- Conditional logic and loops
- File handling
- Basic cybersecurity concepts (password strength, entropy)
